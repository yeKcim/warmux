* USAGE NOTES 
************************************************************************ 

1. Exceptions, leaves and the cleanup stack 

Some STLport functions may throw exceptions, as defined by the ISO/IEC 
C++ Standard. You should always protect your application's entry point 
with a try-catch block in order to prevent exceptions from escaping and 
crashing the program. STLport functions don't leave by themselves, but 
the PIPS library expects a cleanup stack to be present, so you need to 
provide one if it isn't created automatically. Read the PIPS 
documentation for further details. 

2. Writable Static Data 

STLport contains non-const static data in several places. This may be an 
issue if you're generating a DLL that links against STLport. Although 
Writable Static Data (WSD) in DLLs is allowed in Symbian 9.1, it is 
usually recommended to avoid it if possible, using alternative 
approaches instead (such as Thread-Local Storage). The task of converting
static variables to TLS data will be hopefully carried out in a future 
release. 

3. Default path for file streams 

It is recommended to always specify a fully-qualified path name when 
opening or creating files through the fstream interface. However, if the 
path name is missing, it will be set to the application's private 
directory (which will be created automatically if necessary). 

NOTE: PIPS file-related functions (open, fopen, etc.) also use the 
      application's private directory as the default path, but they 
      always assume that such private directory is located on drive C:.
      STLport, on the contrary, will try to determine where the 
      application is installed and will try to create/use the default 
      path on the most appropriate drive.
