Welcome to STLport for Symbian OS! 

If you don't know what STLport is, please go to 
http://stlport.sourceforge.net. 

This package contains a patched version of the STLport library that can 
be used on devices powered by the Symbian OS operating system, version 
9.1 and newer. The original STLport readme files are present in this 
package's root directory, please refer to them for any question 
regarding STLport itself.
