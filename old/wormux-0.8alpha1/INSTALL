==============
* Dependencies
==============

If the following software is not presently on your system, you will need to download them
before attempting to install Wormux 0.8 on your computer...

* SDL
-----

Wormux needs the SDL library version 1.2.

It can be downloaded of their website: http://www.libsdl.org/

* SDL mixer, SDL image, SDL ttf and SDL gfx, SDL net
----------------------------------------------------

SDL is splitted is small modules. Wormux needs mixer (sound), image (load
picture file), ttf (draw text), gfx (graphical things) and net (network).

You may have trouble to install SDL gfx: Wormux *needs* version 2.0.13 or
greater. Download it and compile it.

* libxml++
----------

Wormux uses the libxml++ library version 2.6.

Get it here: http://libxmlplusplus.sourceforge.net/

Under Debian, use the command:
	apt-get install libxml++2.6-dev


============================
* Compilation / Installation
============================

If you're using SubVersion version of Wormux, will have first to type:

    ./autogen.sh

Under Linux, enter the Wormux directory, then simply type:

	./configure
	make
	
then, as root, type:
	
	make install

By default, the game is installed in /usr/local. But you can specify another
directory (useful if you don't have access to the root account) by modifying the
initial configure command:

	./configure --prefix=/OTHER/DIRECTORY/HERE

==============
* Uninstalling
==============

To uninstall Wormux, go to the source directory, then (as root):

	make uninstall


===============
* Other options
===============

Many options can be used with the configure command.
The most useful (for developers, at least) being:

	./configure --enable-debug

This enables you to compile Wormux with debug options, allowing you to track down bugs/other problems.

To get a list of all the other configuration options, type:

	./configure --help
